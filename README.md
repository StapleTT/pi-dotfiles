# pi-dotfiles

This script helps set up your development environment by automating the installation and configuration of various tools:
- **Alacritty & Fish Shell**: Installs the Alacritty terminal and sets Fish as your default shell, enhanced with the Starship prompt for a modern, user-friendly experience.
- **Neovim Configuration**: Installs and configures Neovim with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and several other plugins.
- **Caps Lock to Escape**: Remaps the Caps Lock key to Escape using `keyd` for more efficient text editing.
- **Enhanced File Listing with `eza`**: Displays file icons in the terminal when using `ls`, making file navigation more intuitive.
- **[Optional] Greetd & Sway**: Replaces your desktop and login manager with Greetd and Sway, offering a minimal and efficient window manager setup (shown in screenshots below).

During installation, youâ€™ll have the choice to either install the dotfiles only or to include the optional desktop replacement.
