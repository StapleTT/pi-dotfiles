# pi-dotfiles

Will this be the most descriptive readme in the world? No. But here's a brief breakdown of this script.

This was made for Raspberry Pi 4, but may run on other 64-bit aarch64 machines running Debian-based distros. x86 compatibility is not guaranteed.
All packages & dependencies will automatically be installed.

To get started, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/StapleTT/pi-dotfiles
cd pi-dotfiles
./install.sh
```
NOTE: This script requires sudo privileges. Running this script without sudo privileges will break stuff.
